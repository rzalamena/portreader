portreader

This is a small tool to read and write stuff directly to the physical memory or port address.
You should only use this if you really know what are you doing.

Usage
---

Compile the program from source:
 $ make
or
 $ gcc portreader.c -o portreader

Call it:
 $ ./portreader

Fill the fields according to the questions.

or

 $ ./portreader [<mem or port> [[<address - dec or hex> <range>] <value - dec or hex>]]
 example:
 $ ./portreader port 0x03ff0000 0 0x00000000
 or
 $ ./portreader port 0x03ff0000 0 500

If you just want to read from memory/port then:
 $ ./portreader port 0x03ff0000

or if you want to read a range
 $ ./portreader port 0x03ff0000 10

and then when it asks for a value to write, abort the program with interrupt signal (CTRL + C | ^C)

If you need more info about what is going on in the background, just active the debugging in the program macro.

If you want to translate the hex numbers output to char just active the 'show char' macro.
