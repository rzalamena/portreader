portreader

This is a small tool to read and write stuff directly to the physical memory or port address.
You should only use this if you really know what are you doing.

Usage
---

Compile the program from source:
 $ make
or
 $ gcc portreader.c -o portreader

Call it:
 $ ./portreader

Fill the fields according to the questions.

or

 $ ./portreader [mem or port] [address to read/write from] [value to write in the address]
 example:
 $ ./portreader port 0x03ff0000 0x00000000
 or
 $ ./portreader port 0x03ff0000 500

If you just want to read from memory/port then:
 $ ./portreader port 0x03ff0000

and then when it asks for a value to write, abort the program with interrupt signal (CTRL + C | ^C)

If you need more info about what is going on in the background, just active the debugging in the program macro.
